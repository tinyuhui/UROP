How long does it take for a population to reach its new equilibrium r^2 value (calculated solving the 2nd Park recursion)?
The plots (which show the number of generations to reach this value up to a 10% precision) show of this varies for different recombination rates.
The R file is self-contained, as it uses Park's recursion and not a simulator.
