"theory_and_proposals" contains the pdfs of the various ideas. There is  minor mistake in the r^2 of "between_pop_approach2_multinomial.pdf" (it should be 1 - that value), but it has been
adjusted in the simulations.

"normal_within_population_measure" contains the code and simuulations plots for the multinomial based / normal test. 
Overall, it doesn't perform very well. You can think of it as "it only uses 2 pieces of the 8 frequencies, so doesn't make accurate predictions".

The "likelihood_ratio_test" does much better, separability is solid. I am confident that Approximate Bayesian Computation is going to be possible with this method.
