In /code "main_park_2012_simulator.R" is the main script (which is fully commented). The rest of the files are files you need to run before you can run the main file 
(they are the code for the simulators we are comparing in the main script).

In the plottings we can see that the 2nd recursion formulated by Park is the one that better describes the true dynamics of the system (i.e. the computationally-expensive individual based simulator)
